# Brief Overview
Aim is to create an automated system to predict the appropriate price of a diamond based on its shape/size/color etc. Task is to create a machine learning model which can predict the price of a diamond based on its characteristics.


# Diamonds Dataset:
This classic dataset contains the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000 diamonds. It's a great dataset for machine learning and work with data analysis and visualization.
The dataset link https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e8/data?select=train.csv(https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e8/data?select=train.csv)
It contains information about various diamonds, including their attributes and corresponding prices. The dataset is provided in csv format and can be found in the data directory.

## DataSet Columns:
    - Price: Price in US dollars
    - Carat: Weight of the diamond
    - Cut: quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)
    - Color: Diamond Colour
    - Clarity: A measurement of how clear the diamond is (l1 (worst) , SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF(best))
    - x: length in mm
    - y: width in mm
    - z: depth in mm
    - table: width of top of diamond relative to widest point.

# Machine Learning
On the given dataset we used regression on all of the coloumns that were related to the price of columns and for classification use all columns that were related to the cut column.

Regression Algorithms Used
    - Lasso Regression
    - Linear Regression
    - Ridge Regression
    - ElasticNet Regressor
    - Decision Tree Regressor
